# FAQ Yourself
Frequently Asked Questions you should ask yourself before asking them again.


## Instructions


### While you're studying computer science / information technology
1. Buy a computer (we suggest you to install a [SSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive));
2. Learn English (intermediate level);
3. Use Google [efficiently](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/20-tips-use-google-search-efficiently.html);
4. Learn how to [debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging) in your enviroment
  * E.g. Do you use Android Studio? Google it: [how to debug in android studio](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+debug+in+android+studio)


### Before you ask for a meeting
1. Debug your code.

2. Google your problem, in English. Keep it simple and gradually add search terms;
  * If you have a compile error/warning message, google it directly (possibly with quotes)
  
3. Updates the software that gives you troubles to the latest version (unless otherwise noted);
  
4. Post your problem on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and interact with its unkind users;

5. Post your problem on various dedicated forums;
* To find a forum use Google (e.g. "android forum")
  
6. Ask on various dedicated [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) channels;
  * How to use IRC? Google it
  * How to find an IRC channel? Google it (e.g. "android irc channel")
  
### When everything above fails
1. Gather all failed attempts in a text file (txt, rtf, md, etc. not .docx). For each attempt, you should describe:
 * What you searched for
 * What you found and tried
 * What was the error message when it failed

2. Write an email, but don't just ask "can I have a meeting?", state your problem via mail. A proper email should contain:

 * Context (e.g. "I'm dealing with Section X of Project Y...", if needed add description of your environment)
 * Problem (e.g. "While trying technique/tool/etc., X went wrong") with error description
 * The "failed attempts file report" above

3. If the problem can't be solved via email, you will be asked for a live or online meeting.

### Just before a meeting
1. Make sure your environment works and you can reproduce the problem.
2. Switch on the computer
